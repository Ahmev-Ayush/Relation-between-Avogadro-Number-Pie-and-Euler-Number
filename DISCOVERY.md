## Background & Motivation

The seed of this exploration was planted during my Class 11 Physics course
while studying Chapter 2 — *"Units and Measurements"* from the NCERT
textbook (2018–19 edition). Problem **2.33** describes how the legendary
physicist **P.A.M. Dirac** loved playing with the numerical values of
fundamental constants of nature. The problem reads:

> *"A great physicist of this century (P.A.M. Dirac) loved playing with
> numerical values of Fundamental constants of nature. This led him to
> an interesting observation. Dirac found that from the basic constants
> of atomic physics (c, e, mass of electron, mass of proton) and the
> gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the
> dimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude
> being close to the present estimate on the age of the universe
> (~15 billion years). From the table of fundamental constants in this
> book, try to see if you too can construct this number (or any other
> interesting number you can think of). If its coincidence with the age
> of the universe were significant, what would this imply for the
> constancy of fundamental constants?"*

This problem captivated me. The idea that a physicist could simply *play*
with known constants and stumble upon something as profound as the age of
the universe was deeply inspiring. It raised a question in my mind:

**What other hidden relationships might exist between fundamental
constants — physical and mathematical — waiting to be noticed?**

## Method of Discovery

Motivated by Dirac's playful spirit, I set out on a journey of
**systematic trial and exploration**. My approach was hands-on and
experimental rather than derived from theory:

1. **Tool Used:** I performed all my calculations on the
   [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) mobile application — a free
   scientific graphing calculator. No specialized mathematical software
   was used during the discovery phase.

2. **Approach:** I began constructing various combinations of well-known
   mathematical constants — specifically **π (pi)** and **e (Euler's
   number, ≈ 2.71828...)** — raised to different integer powers, combined
   with simple integer multipliers and divisors.

3. **Target:** My goal was to see whether any such combination could
   reproduce **Avogadro's number** ($N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$),
   or at least its mantissa ($\approx 6.022...$), to a striking degree
   of precision.

4. **Process:** Through patient **hit-and-trial** — testing dozens of
   combinations of the form $k^a / (\pi^b \cdot e^c)$ with varying
   integer values — I eventually landed on a combination that matched
   $N_A$ to a surprising number of significant digits.

This was not a theoretical derivation; it was an act of **numerical
exploration**, much in the spirit of Dirac's own playful curiosity. The
discovery emerged from persistence, pattern recognition, and a genuine
love for the beauty hidden in numbers.

## Why This Matters to Me

What started as a textbook exercise in a high school physics class turned
into an independent exploration of the landscape of fundamental constants.
Regardless of whether this relation reflects a deeper mathematical truth
or is a beautiful coincidence, the process reaffirmed something Dirac
himself believed:

> *"God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world."*
> — P.A.M. Dirac

This repository is my attempt to document that small act of curiosity for
the public record.
