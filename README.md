## The Relation

This repository documents a mathematical coincidence (or deeper relation)
connecting Avogadro's number ($N_A$) with fundamental mathematical constants:

$$
N_A = \frac{k^a}{\pi^b \cdot e^c} \times 10^{23}
$$

The relation being:
$$
N_A = \frac{380}{\pi \cdot e^3} \times 10^{23}
$$

Where:
| Symbol | Value | Description              |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| $N_A$  | 6.02214076 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ | Avogadro's number (2019 SI exact) |
| $k$    | 380   | Integer discovered in this work |
| $a$    | 1   | Integer exponent |
| $b$    | 1   | Integer exponent of π |
| $c$    | 3   | Integer exponent of e |

## Numerical Verification

The relation is accurate to **4 decimal places**, yielding a value of $N_A \approx 6.02213210 \times 10^{23} \text{ mol}^{-1}$. This represents a **relative error** of $\approx 8.66 \times 10^{-6}$ compared to the exact 2019 SI value ($6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$).
